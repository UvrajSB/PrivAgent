# üîê Privacy-First Computing with Agent MCP

This project showcases a groundbreaking approach to privacy-preserving computation using **homomorphic encryption** through a **Model Computation & Processing (MCP) server**. This project demonstrate the technology with a practical movie recommendation system that keeps user preferences completely private.

## üåê Vision & Core Technology

### Homomorphic Encryption & MCP Server
At the heart of this project is the MCP server, which enables a revolutionary approach to data processing:

- **Compute on Encrypted Data**: Using homomorphic encryption (HE), the server performs calculations on encrypted data without ever seeing the actual values
- **Zero Knowledge Processing**: The server remains completely blind to both input data and computation results
- **Mathematical Operations**: Supports operations like dot products and vector similarity calculations while data remains encrypted
- **End-to-End Privacy**: Data stays encrypted during transit, processing, and storage

### Privacy-First Architecture

## üí° Practical Application: Movie Recommendations

We demonstrate this technology through a privacy-preserving movie recommendation system:

### How It Works
1. **User Preferences**
   - Users' movie preferences are converted into feature vectors
   - These vectors are encrypted on the user's device using BFV homomorphic encryption
   - Only encrypted versions ever leave the user's device

2. **Secure Processing**
   ```python
   @mcp.tool()
   def match_movies() -> str:
       # Server only sees encrypted vectors
       encrypted_preferences = deserialize_bfvvector(encrypted_b64, context)
       
       # Movie matching happens on encrypted data
       for title, movie_vector in MOVIES.items():
           # Compute similarity while data remains encrypted
           similarity_score = encrypted_preferences * movie_vector
           results[title] = serialize_bfvvector(similarity_score)
   ```

3. **Privacy-Preserving Matching**
   - Movie vectors are stored on the server
   - Similarity scores are computed through encrypted dot products
   - Results are returned in encrypted form
   - Only the user's device can decrypt and interpret the recommendations

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd PrivRec
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configuration**

   ```

3. **Usage Example**
   ```python
   # On user device
   preferences = [8, 2, 9]  # User's movie preferences
   encrypted_prefs = list_encryption(preferences)
   
   # On MCP server (data remains encrypted)
   recommendations = match_movies(encrypted_prefs)
   
   # Back on user device
   decrypted_results = decrypt_interest_results(recommendations)
   ```
